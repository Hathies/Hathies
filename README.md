- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hathies
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Electrical Engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding on the topic of Electrical Design and Construction

My current goal of this git is to setup a personal project management system along with exploring electrical design and construction from requirement specification, prototyping, testing to finaly end up with a product.

The reason for doing this in a such structured nature, instead of freeballing everything, is to get a better understanding for how the project models used in my professional life are used. With, hopefully, an added bennefit of structuring my projects in smaller tasks that are easier managed when done sporadicly during my free time.
